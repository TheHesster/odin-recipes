<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Black bean soup is the meal to have on those busy days and you are short on time! It has easy pantry staple ingredients, simple to make, and is a fulfilling dinner everyone loves. This is a smooth and creamy textured soup with all the flavor. Kids to adults love this soup!

  Hearty and satisfying, this black bean soup can be thrown together in under thirty minutes but tastes like it’s been simmering all day. My family likes to add their own individual favorites like avocado, sour cream, cheese, or tortilla crisps to the top, but I love it just the way it is. Warm, soothing, simple, the perfect busy weeknight dinner.
